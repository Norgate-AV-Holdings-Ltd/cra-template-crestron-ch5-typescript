## Enable Husky Git Hooks :dog:

Currently, to use the Husky Git Hooks feature provided by this template you must manually run the following command within the project directory after the bootstrap completes. This will update the local git configuration to use the hooks in the `.husky` directory.

```sh
npm run husky:install

# or

yarn husky:install
```

## Project Configuration :zap:

To upload to a Crestron touchscreen or control system using the scripts provided by this template, add the IP address or hostname to the project properties in `package.json`.

```json
{
    "crestron": {
        "project": {
            "touchscreen": {
                "url": "Enter IP/Hostname of Crestron Touchpanel here...",
                "type": "touchscreen"
            },
            "web": {
                "url": "Enter IP/Hostname of Crestron Processor here...",
                "type": "web",
                "config": {
                    "host": "localhost",
                    "ipId": "0x03",
                    "roomId": ""
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Available Scripts :rocket:

In the project directory, you can run:

### Create React App

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

### Crestron CH5

#### `yarn build:archive`

Builds a Crestron CH5 `.ch5z` archive file from the most recent build and outputs to the dist folder.

#### `yarn build:deploy:touchscreen`

Deploys the Crestron CH5 `.ch5z` archive file from the dist folder to a touchscreen.

#### `yarn build:onestep:touchscreen`

Executes the build, archive and deploy steps in sequence.

#### `yarn build:deploy:web`

Deploy the Crestron CH5 `.ch5z` archive file from the dist folder to a control system.

#### `yarn build:onestep:web`

Executes the build, archive and deploy steps in sequence.

### Docker

#### `yarn build:docker`

Builds the application into a lightweight Docker image.\
Creates a Docker container from the image running on the port specified in the `.env` file.\
The default port is `8080`.\
You can then view your application at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Electron

#### `yarn build:electron`

Builds the application into a standalone Electron desktop application and outputs to the app directory.

#### `yarn electron:dev`

Starts the Electron application in development mode.\
The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### General

#### `yarn clean:all`

Deletes the `app`, `build` and `dist` directories.

#### `yarn commit`

Invokes the [Commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) CLI and walks you through a series of prompts to fill out the commit message in the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.

#### `yarn lint`

Will run the linter on the project and report any errors.

#### `yarn lint:fix`

Will run the linter on the project and automatically fix any fixable errors.\
This script is run automatically by [Lint-Staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) on any files being committed to the Git repository if [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) is enabled. See [here](#enable-husky-git-hooks-dog) to enable Husky.

#### `yarn pretty:fix`

Applies the Prettier formatting rules to the project.\
This script is run automatically by [Lint-Staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) on any files being committed to the Git repository if [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) is enabled. See [here](#enable-husky-git-hooks-dog) to enable Husky.
